# Welcome to My GitHub Profile
In my GitHub repositories, various projects showcase my skills and interests. These projects range from small experiments and prototypes to more extensive applications and tools. I strive to create clean, efficient, well-documented code, emphasizing best practices and maintainability.

Here are some highlights from my significant projects:

1) Age Detection of Indian actors: Predicted the age of different Indian actors using Tensorflow and Keras with an ensemble of deep learning models like EfficientNetB7, InceptionV3 and Resnet50.
2) Loan Prediction: Predicted whether a person will get the loan using an ensemble of machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gaussian NB and Random Forest.
3) House Price Prediction: Predicted the price of a house based on different features like house area, pool area, etc., using regression models like Laso and Ridge.

You can go ahead and explore my repositories to get a better understanding of my work and coding style.
